Potential improvements
    Find way to only get 2y of dividends
    Include latest value for stock (Michael)
    Simulation module
    
    Undo transaction in portfolio
    Safeguard for overwrite of portfolio
    
    sortable portfolio history (overall portfolio split amongst trading strategies)
    A way to print out analysis filtered by portfolio components
    
    Overload stock + and -
    Report rates of retun in report
    
    Dynamically create and update "ticker.csv"
    
    7 day rolling average addition to analysis
    separate/restore previous versions of analysis
    
    Realized/Unrealized gains
    Tax handling
    
    Having to recalculate ratios in every iteration of simulation
    

In Progress
    how do we do dividends? and adj close...? (probably involves context objectification)
    
    
Completed Work
    Fix floating point arithmetic issues
    Allow user to do buys and sells by total price instead of avg cost per share
    Sort Reporting by total current value
    Creating history object (move rounding to transaction)
    Datetime logging
    show current value of each equity inside report
    rate of return calculations
    
Analysis Versions
    1.0: Simple stochastic 1Y-3M and 1Y-3W for long and short-term respectively using adj close
        1.0.0: Simple sort by 1Y-3*. Sell when below average/median
        1.0.1: Sell when 1Y-3* negative
        1.0.2: Sell short-term when 0, or long-term when held for more than 1Y
    1.1: Implemented potential in metric calculations
        1.1.0: Percentage off maximum multiplied by constant factor and added to 1Y-3* to define metric
        1.1.1: Percentage off maximum replaced by potential to reach "equilibrium" value.
        1.1.2: % off equilibrium multiplied by variable and added to 1Y-3* such that top of the list was 100%
        
        
Analysis Ideas
    Rolling x-day average to reduce variability in closing prices
    Use dividend and closing price instead of adjusted close so make compatible with future simulation methods
